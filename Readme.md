# Towards a more general approach for the identification of sacharides.

This Master thesis aims to create a fast and easy usable way to identify sacharides using NMR spectroscopy.
This was done by altering the 1D-selTOCSY pulse program to create a 2D-selTOCSY using the mixing time as a second variable.
We have included the option to use this on multiple frequencies in one experiment; for an even easier analysis.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For the analysis a 700MHz NMR-spectrometer was used. The only channel needed is a Hydrogen-channel.
This processing script uses Python 3.5; it was made using Anaconda. The required modules are:

```
NMRGlue		-	http://www.nmrglue.com/
Numpy		-	http://www.numpy.org/
Scipy		-	https://www.scipy.org/

```

### Installing 

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Usage and setup for analysis

### Setup the experiment

Explain what these tests test and why

### Setup the processing tools

```
Give an example
```
